## Requirements

1. [SMAPI](#smapi-setup)
2. [Project Fluent](#installing-project-fluent)

### SMAPI setup

#### For Windows

_Note: Follow the [Xbox Setup](#xbox-setup) if using the xbox/gamepass version of the game._

1. Before installing SMAPI, run the game at least once.
2. Download the [latest version of SMAPI](https://smapi.io/).
3. Extract the .zip file somewhere. (Your downloads folder is fine)
4. Double-click `install on Windows.bat`, and follow the on-screen instructions.

##### Xbox Setup

**Before you install SMAPI:**

1. Open the Stardew Valley section in the Xbox app.
2. Click the `3 dots button` (should be next to the share button) then `Manage button`
3. Click the `Files tab` and then `Browse button` to open your game folder
4. Open the Stardew Valley > Content folder. You should see a lot of files with names like api-ms-win-core-\*
5. Copy the full path from the address bar at the top.

**Run the SMAPI installer:**

Run the SMAPI installer like usual, but:

- Download the installer to somewhere that's not the game directory (like your downloads folder).
- When it asks where to install, enter the path you copied from the previous step. (In cmd, you can either `right click`
  or `Ctrl V` to paste)

**After you install SMAPI:**

In your game folder:

1. rename `Stardew Valley.exe` to another name such as `Stardew Valley original.exe`
2. make a copy of `StardewModdingAPI.exe` and name the copy `Stardew Valley.exe`
3. That's it! Now just launch the game through the Xbox app to play with mods.

_Note that when the game updates, you'll need to redo the last two sections._

##### Configuring the game client

Configuring the game client is not a necessary step, only do this if you want the tracking and awards from the client.
If you choose not to then you will have to launch the game through `StardewModdingAPI.exe`.

_(Note that this gets automatically taken care of for the xbox version while installing SMAPI)_

###### For Steam

1. Open the `properties` for Stardew (you can do this by right clicking the game in the library and then
   selecting `properties` from the drop down list)
2. Go to the `Launch Options` in the `General` tab and paste the following line:
    - `"{Stardew Valley Folder path}\StardewModdingAPI.exe" %command%`
    - Replace the `{Stardew Valley Folder path}` with the correct path.
    - Default for most users
      is: `"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Stardew Valley\StardewModdingAPI.exe" %command%`

###### For GOG Galaxy

1. Open Notepad and paste in the following:
    - `start "" "{Stardew Valley Folder path}\StardewModdingAPI.exe"`
    - Replace the `{Stardew Valley Folder path}` with the correct path.
    - Default for most users
      is: `start "" "C:\Program Files (x86)\GOG Galaxy\Games\Stardew Valley\StardewModdingAPI.exe"`
2. Save the file with the name `start.bat` into the Stardew Valley folder. Make sure to change `Save as type`
   to `all files` when saving.
3. In the GOG Galaxy client, click on Stardew Valley > settings icon > Manage installation > Configure.
4. In the menu that appears, enable the `Custom executables / arguments` checkbox.
5. Click Add another `executable / arguments`.
6. Choose `start.bat` in the window that appears and click Open.
7. Enable the `Default Executable` radio button under the File 2 section you just added, and click OK.

#### For Linux

1. On many Linux distributions, you may need to download and install an older version of libssl (1.1 or 1.x).
    - On Ubuntu, Debian, Linux Mint, and other Debian-based installations, install libssl1.1 (by
      running `sudo apt install libssl1.1` on a terminal).
    - On Arch Linux and its derivatives, install openssl-1.1 by running `sudo pacman -S openssl-1.1`.
    - On Fedora and its derivatives, install openssl-1.1 by running `sudo dnf in openssl1.1`.
2. Download the latest version of SMAPI.
3. Extract the .zip file somewhere (Your downloads folder is fine).
4. If you installed Steam through Flatpak, see these instructions:
5. instructions for Flatpak
6. Run the `install on Linux.sh` file, and follow the on-screen instructions.
    - (If the installer asks for your game install path, see how to find your game
      folder - [here](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Player_Guide/Getting_Started#Find_your_game_folder).)

#### For MacOS

1. Download the latest version of SMAPI.
2. Extract the .zip file somewhere (Your downloads folder is fine).
3. Double-click `install on Mac.command`, and follow the on-screen instructions.

### Installing Project Fluent

As of v1.5.0, the [Project Fluent mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/12638) is now a dependency for
stardew access and as such, the mod won't run without
it.
Project Fluent is mainly used for providing a way to have translation mods for stardew access and also the ability to
use [Mozilla's project fluent](https://projectfluent.org/) instead of regular json for translation files.

Installation of Project Fluent is essentially the same as installing any other mod, here are the steps:

1. Download the v1.1.0 of Project Fluent
   from [this Nexus direct link](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/12638?tab=files&file_id=56519) ([login](https://users.nexusmods.com/auth/sign_in)
   if you haven't already) or
   from [Github](https://github.com/Shockah/Stardew-Valley-Mods/releases/download/release%2Fproject-fluent%2F1.1.0/ProjectFluent.1.1.0.zip).
    - Do note that the Github link is only temporary and might get removed in future as the owner only publishes mod
      updates to Nexus.
2. Extract the zip file and move it into the `Mods` folder in your game's folder.

## Mod Installation

1. Download the latest version from [Github](https://github.com/khanshoaib3/stardew-access/releases/latest) or
   from [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/16205/?tab=files).
2. Extract the zip file (extracting it into the download folder should be fine).
3. Copy/Cut the generated `stardew-access` folder.
4. Paste it into the `Mods` folder in your game folder.

_In case you are experiencing any kinds of bugs, it is recommended that you install the debug zip.
It will generate more stuff in the log helpful for debugging._

## Updating The Mod

To update you just need to delete or move the mod folder from the `Mods` folder to somewhere else and repeat the
installation instruction from the previous section.
